The game has support for multiple languages :D

## Compile the game

First, download the C/C++ toolchain and install it, then run the following command in the root directory of the project.

```batch
mingw32-make
```

The above command will generate a new `out` directory, go to that directory and double click the executable. Enjoy!

## Game assets

Some assets were retrieved from opengameart.org, for more information read `res/LICENCES`.
